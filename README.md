MiniAP
------

This is a minimal ActivityPub server written in Ruby with Grape. This follows the bases of Mastodon's [How to implement a basic ActivityPub server](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/).

Very basic at the moment, the idea is to explore AP a bit and interact with some servers locally.

Do not interact with real servers, this thing is not ready for that :)

Use [zrok](https://github.com/openziti/zrok) for external addresses + https
